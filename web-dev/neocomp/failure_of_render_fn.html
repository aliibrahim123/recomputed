	<h3><q>React is Slow</q>.</h3>
	<p>how many time have you heard that? you cant count.<br>
		it is known that <a -href="webdiv.react">React</a> and other frameworks especially VDOM based ones  have a lot of performance issues. but have you asked why?</p>
	<p>to answer this question, lets look at the beginning of the modern age of frontend frameworks to see what really went wrong.</p>

	<h1>The Promise of React</h1>
	<h2>The Frameworks before React</h2>
	<p>the web before React was simple, most websites are static / server rendered pages, with some javascript sprinkled on top for simple but good interactivity. but if you want to do any advance work on the client side, your options are, compared to day, are a little bit less reactive.</p>
	<p>pre-React frameworks like <a -href="webdiv.backbone">Backbone</a> and others were classical OOP inspired MVCs. they focused alot on the code structure and the data layer, and less if any on the view layer and data binding.</p>
	<p>when you want to update a DOM node, you would use the limited templating provided by your framework, or you would use <a -href='webdiv.jquery'>JQuery</a>to query the node and update it manually.</p>
	<p>the MVC frameworks  </p>
	<p>and then, React came and changed the whole web with a revolutionary concept.</p>
